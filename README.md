### Hi there 👋

I am a robot researcher who can independently design, build and control a complex robot system, with experience and networking for rapidly building robot prototypes and coding debugging capabilities. I am interested in Optimal Control, Mechanical Design, and Legged Robots and want to build extraordinary agility robots by using optimization-based methods.

**I’m looking for a Ph.D. position in robotics.** Please let me know if you are interested in my background and have a available position!😄️
