### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a robot researcher who can independently design, build and control a complex robot system, with experience and networking for rapidly building robot prototypes and coding debugging capabilities. I am interested in Optimal Control, Mechanical Design, and Legged Robots and want to build extraordinary agility robots using optimization-based methods.

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. Now I am working as Undergraduate Researcher in SUSTech.
